TEST COMMIT


# Okta Developer Site

Okta developer site (developer.okta.com) is a custom [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site deployed on [GitHub
pages](https://pages.github.com/)

All API documentation submissions are welcome. To submit a change, fork this repo, commit your changes, and send us a
[pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/)


## Setup Environment

Most of the content of the developer site is written in a format called
[kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) which is a flavor of Markdown with some enhanced features like the
ability to do footnote notations. We use Kramdown because the markup is both human readable and convertible in to fully
fledged HTML. If there's some functionality you can't implement in Kramdown you can always drop down into HTML as a
last resort.

Though kramdown gives us benefits of readability it comes at the cost of requiring a build step to preview the changes to
the site. Jekyll, handles this nicely by detecting changes to the file system and refreshing automatically. To setup
Jekyll to be able to build and view the site, follow the steps below: 

1. Install RVM if you don't already have it. On OSX [install the stable version](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) or on linux `yum install rvm`. To ensure you have
   rvm installed properly run `rvm list` and ensure that there is a version marked as 'current'.
2. Clone repository `git clone git@github.com:okta/okta.github.io.git`
3. Go into project directory `cd okta.github.io`
4. You may be told that the version of ruby needed by this project isn't installed, follow the given instruction to
   install the correct version of ruby for RVM. If you did have to install a new version of ruby re-enter the directory
   you're in: `cd ..;cd okta.github.io` then verify that the current gemset you're using is called "okta.github.io" by
   running `rvm gemset list`. This project specifies a gemset so that the build of this project isn't affected by global
   gems on your system.
5. Now install gems needed by this project into the projects gemset with `gem install bundler` and then `bundle install`.
   This will essentially read the Gemfile in the root directory and install all packages required to run the site.
6. Start the site `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`
8. Visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser
9. To stop serving the site hit `ctrl+c` in the terminal

## Publishing Changes (the build process)

Though Github Pages do support an automatic build process, we use a custom toolbar gem which requires that we build the
site ourselves. This means that this git repo contains both the source files of the site and the compiled site files. As
we edit the site we should only make changes to the source files and then rely on the following build process to compile
and generate the final site content.

### Important Directories

* **_source** this is where the source files live. If you're editing content, or adding assets like images or CSS, they
  belong in here
* **docs** The output HTML files live in this directory. Don't edit this content, it'll be overwritten with every build.
* **_site** this directory is ignored in github. It contains the local version of each of the built files in the site
* **almost everything else** most of the other directories in the root are the checked in versions of the built site.
  These files should not be edited directly. Find the corresponding version of the file in the _source directory, modify
  that and then re-run the build.

### Build Steps

1. Create a topic branch of your work `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
2. Make changes / additions in _source directory
3. Compile changes into the _site directory `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`
4. Navigate the site and validate your changes
5. Stop Jekyll with `ctrl+c`
6. Discard changed files (they have "localhost:4000" in link URLs instead of "developer.okta.com") with `git checkout .`
7. Build again with `rm _site/*; bundle exec jekyll build`
8. Sync the built _site files with the checked-in code with: `rsync -av _site/ ./`
9. Git commit and push changes to github. When ready for review create a pull request and mention the users you want to
   review your changes.

### Resolving conflicts with "upstream"

If you are making changes in a fork, here is how to make a clean Pull Request against "upstream":

1. [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#keep-your-fork-synced) to https://github.com/okta/okta.github.io/
   The command `git remote add upstream git@github.com:okta/okta.github.io.git` is the key part of this step.
2. After running `git fetch upstream` in the guide above, run this command to pull down changes from upstream:
   `git merge -s recursive -X theirs upstream/master`

## Contribution Process

Okta uses the
[GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
workflow for contributions.

Please read the linked
[GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
document to learn the details of that workflow.

Here is a high-level overview of the GitHub flow:

1.  (Optional) Fork this repository.
2.  *Create a branch* using the `git checkout -b $BRANCH_NAME` command.
    Replace `$BRANCH_NAME` with your branch name.
3.  *Add commits* to your branch using the `git add` and `git commit -m ""` commands.
    Push your commits to your branch with the `git push` command (for
    example: `git push origin $BRANCH_NAME`).
4.  *Open a Pull Request*
    [using the GitHub UI](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
5.  *Discuss and review your code* using the GitHub UI.
6.  Once your Pull Request has been reviewed and approved, one of the
    project owners for this site will *merge and deploy* your Pull
    Request.

### Details for the "Add commits" step

1. Clone repository using `git clone` - the files are organized in this repository as follows:
    * The root folder `./` contains the files served by GitHub.
    * `_source` folder contains the source files.
    * `_site` is still ignored.
2. Create a branch for your changes using `git checkout -b $BRANCH_NAME` to create a branch for your changes.
3. Make changes under the `_source` directory.
4. Serve the site locally using the `jekyll serve -w` command.
5. Preview using <http://locahost:4000>.

### Details for the "merge and deploy" step

Do the following after accepting a pull request:

1. Pull down the latest changes using `git pull origin master` to pull down the latest changes.
2. Compile the site locally using the `jekyll build` command.
3. rsync files from the `_site` directory to repository root directory `./` with the `rsync -r _site/ ./` command.
4. Add the updated files using the `git add .` command.
5. Commit the updated files using the `git commit -m "your message here"` command.
6. Push to GitHub using `git push origin master` to push to GitHub. Note that GitHub will not compile the site.


## Authoring Guide

### Pages

Pages are single purpose html or markdown files

1. Create a folder with `index.html` file. (e.g. *pricing/index.html*)
2. Author front matter as follows:

 ```
---
layout: page
title: YOUR_TITLE
css: CSS_FILENAME.css (optional page specific css file)
---
```
3. Put html or css content under front matter
4. Expose link to page in header or elsewhere. URL will be the folder
   name, `index.html` is not necessary (e.g. */pricing*)

### Docs

1.  Create `PAGE_NAME.md` in `docs/FOLDER_NAME` (e.g. *docs/api/rest/users.md*)
2.  Filenames are underscore seperated and all lowercase. (e.g. *my_cool_doc_page.md*)
3.  Author front matter

 ```
---
layout: docs_page
title: Title Case Name of Page
---
```
4.  The content under the front matter should not have any `h1`s -
    this will be set by the `title` property
5.  All `h2`s in the content will be rendered as a link in the table
    of contents
6.  Create placement entry in manifest at `_data/docs.yml` in
    appropriate `pages` section.
7.  The `pages` name must match the filename without extension. (e.g. `users.md` => `users`)
8.  To create a new section in the manifest

 ```
section: NAME_OF_FOLDER
title: TITLE_CASE_NAME_OF_SECTION
```
9.  The sections structure should follow the folder names
10. The ordering of sections and pages in the manifest determines the order in
    which they appear in the leftnav

### Customers

1.  Create an `index.md` folder in `customers/CUSTOMER_NAME` (e.g. *customers/box/index.md*)
2.  Create the images:

```
`index_image`:     220px x 165px @144dpi  // image used on index page
`header_image`:   1080px x 220px @144dpi  // title bar image on story page
`diagram_image`:   694px x <n>px @144dpi  // information graphic at bottom of story page
```
3.  Author front matter

 ```
`index_blurb` will be clipped over three lines of text
`sidebar_copy` will be markdownified. Newlines sohuld be doubled.
```

### Authors

1.  Create an entry in _source/_data/authors.yml
2.  Put avatar image in _source/assets/img. Make sure aspect ratio of image is square.

### Blog Posts

1. Create a file in `_source/_posts/` with the form `YYYY-mm-dd-the-title.md`
2. The header should look something like:

```
---
layout: blog_post
title: Productionalizing ActiveMQ
author: okta_generic_blogger
tags: [activemq, jvm]
---
```

3. Supporting images should be placed in `_source/assets/img` and should follow the convention:
   `<name_of_post>-image-name.extension` where name of the post doesn't include the ".md" extension. This will allow us
   to know which images are referenced by which post.
3. Look at other posts for examples.
